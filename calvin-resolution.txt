Welcome! This is my first and main repository to document my long-term journey in the data world â€” including Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data.

ðŸ§­ Purpose
This repository serves as the foundation for everything Iâ€™ll build, learn, and explore in the data field. It will grow over time as I progress in skills and experience.

ðŸ“‚ Structure (Planned)
- projects/ â†’ Real-world data projects and case studies.
- notebooks/ â†’ Jupyter notebooks for exploration and learning.
- datasets/ â†’ Sample datasets (non-sensitive).
- resources/ â†’ Notes, learning plans, and references.

ðŸ§  Topics To Explore
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Machine learning models (classification, regression, clustering)
- Data visualization
- SQL and database querying
- Big Data tools (e.g., Spark, Hadoop)
- Cloud integration (e.g., GCP, AWS â€“ later stage)

ðŸ”§ Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL
- Git & GitHub
- [Future] Apache Spark, Hadoop

ðŸš€ Future Goals
- Build a solid portfolio of projects
- Share knowledge through notebooks and documentation
- Prepare for internships or roles in the data field

ðŸ“Œ This repository is a starting point a place to grow, experiment, and showcase my development as a data enthusiast. Stay tuned as this journeyÂ unfolds!
